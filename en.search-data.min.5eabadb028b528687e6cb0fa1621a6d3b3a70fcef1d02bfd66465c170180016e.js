By using the cloudback.it website or any services described on the cloudback.it website (collectively, \u0026ldquo;Service\u0026rdquo;), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions (\u0026ldquo;Terms of Service\u0026rdquo;).\nViolation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. Cloudback prohibits certain conduct on the Service as described below. You understand and agree that Cloudback cannot be responsible for conduct or activity on the Service or for \u0026ldquo;Content\u0026rdquo; transmitted, posted, or stored using the Service. You agree to use the Service at your own risk. For the purposes of this agreement \u0026ldquo;Content\u0026rdquo; means information, data files, written text, computer software, music, audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images to which you may have access as part of, or through your use of, the Service.\nAccount Terms  You must be 13 years or older to use this Service.

If Cloudback, its affiliates, or any of the employees, agents, or suppliers of Cloudback (the \u0026ldquo;Cloudback Indemnitees\u0026rdquo;) are faced with a legal claim by a third party arising out of your actual or alleged gross negligence, willful misconduct, violation of law, failure to meet your obligations under the Terms of Service, then you will pay the cost of defending the claim (including reasonable attorney fees) and any damages award, fine, or other amount that is imposed on the Cloudback Indemnitees as a result of the claim. Your obligations under this Section include claims arising out of the acts or omissions of your employees, any other person to whom you have given access to the Services, and any person who gains access to the Services as a result of your failure to meet your security obligations in the Terms of Service, even if the acts or omissions of such persons were not authorized by you. Cloudback will choose legal counsel to defend the claim, provide that these decisions must be reasonable and must be promptly communicated to you. You must comply with our reasonable requests for assistance and cooperation in the defense of the claim. Cloudback may not settle the claim without your consent, although such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. You must pay expenses due under this Section as Cloudback incurs them.

You may not assign these Terms of Service without Cloudback\u0026rsquo;s prior written consent. Cloudback may assign the Terms of Service in whole or in part to an affiliate with sufficient financial standing in order to meet its obligations under the Terms of Service or as part of a corporate reorganization or a sale of its business, and we may transfer your information as part of any such transaction. Cloudback reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the amended Terms of Service as follows: Amended Terms of Service will become effective the earlier of either your acceptance of the amended Terms of Service, your continued use of the Services after written notice of the amended Terms of Service, or thirty days after the date Cloudback posts such amended Terms of Service on the Cloudback website. In addition, if over time you sign multiple orders for a single account, then the Terms of Service incorporated in the latest order posted on the effective date of the latest order will govern the entire account. The failure of Cloudback to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and Cloudback and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Cloudback (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).\nThis document is effective as of 2020-05-22\nContact Us If you have any questions or suggestions about the Terms of Service, do not hesitate to contact us at support@cloudback.it\n"});})();
