      <description>Automated Daily Backups This is why we created Cloudback - to continuously backup a repository and its metadata on a daily basis. By default, Cloudback captures a backup daily at a defined hour according to a defined time zone and puts a resulting archive into defined storage. You can also create a custom schedule to run your backups on non-daily basis.
Schedule You can configure the exact hour you want to capture a backup every day, or define your own schedule.</description>

For instance, Microsoft Windows Compressed Folders does not support AES encryption and isn&amp;rsquo;t able to open any AES-encrypted ZIP archive. Please consider using third-party software.

      <guid>https://docs.cloudback.it/features/deduplication/</guid>
      <description>Data Deduplication With data deduplication, you can save a significant amount of cloud storage space and reduce operational costs. Cloudback offers a simple but efficient technique of data deduplication.
How deduplication works Our backup archives are deterministic. If nothing has changed in a GitHub repository, we create the same archive before encrypting it. Once the archive is encrypted, the AES encryption makes it non-deterministic.
Cloudback compares the checksum of a new deterministic backup with a previous deterministic backup before encrypting it.</description>

      <title>What is a bare git repository and how Cloudback uses it?</title>
      <link>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/git-bare-repo/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/git-bare-repo/</guid>
      <description>A Git bare repository represents a specialized form of a Git repository, distinct in structure and function from a conventional Git repository. Platforms like GitHub utilize bare repositories on their servers. Essentially, when a user initiates a clone command from GitHub, they are interacting with a bare repository stored on GitHub&amp;rsquo;s server. This type of repository is optimized for server-side storage and facilitates efficient and secure management and distribution of code, without the direct editing capabilities found in standard repositories.</description>

      <description>Four months ago, in February 2022, we received a new feature request from our user in our issue tracker. In the request, the user asked us to implement real-time notification support via messengers. As soon as a backup fails or succeeds, he should receive a notification.

      <title>New feature: You can enable data deduplication to reduce storage costs</title>
      <link>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/data-deduplication/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/data-deduplication/</guid>
      <description>The Cloudback team is pleased to announce a new feature: Data deduplication for customer managed storage. The use case is a daily backup for a GitHub repository that&amp;rsquo;s not changed every day. The feature prevents wasting storage space just because Cloudback saves backup archives with the same content every day, even though nothing has changed in your GitHub repository. In certain scenarios, the feature can drastically reduce storage costs.
 The configuration of all existing customer managed storages remains unchanged and data deduplication is disabled.</description>

      <title>Archive encryption is now optional</title>
      <link>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/optional-password-protection/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/optional-password-protection/</guid>
      <description>For security reasons, Cloudback uses AES-256 encryption for all backup archives. If you download a specific backup, you can access its content using the password. The password is sent automatically to your GitHub account primary email. However, some people may find this approach a little bit overcomplicated, especially when using customer managed storage somewhere inside your own secure infrastructure.
We are glad to announce that it is possible to opt-out of password-based encryption now.</description>

      <description>Cloudback sends an email notification to the user if the backup fails. By default, we are using the primary email address taken from the GitHub profile.
We received a feature request to support custom emails for notifications. This may be useful when you have a separate email for such kinds of notifications. We decided to provide such functionality for every account where the Cloudback GitHub Application is installed. Now you can set up a new email address for failed backup notifications for each account using the Account Settings dialog:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, we got a new feature request in our issue tracker. One of Cloudback users asked us to add support for the OpenStack Swift storage provider. We discussed the feature request within the team and started development. We decided to use an S3 API gateway of OpenStack Swift. As a side effect, we introduced an S3 access-key-based provider in addition to OpenStack Swift. Now Cloudback supports any S3 API compatible storage provider.</description>
