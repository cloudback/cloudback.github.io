(“we” or “Cloudback”). This document discusses the steps taken during an incident response plan.\nIncident Response Process  The person who discovers the incident should contact Cloudback by one of the following ways:   Send an email to the support@cloudback.it Raise a request in the Cloudback issue tracker Use any contacts from Contact Us web page   If the person discovering the incident is a member of the Cloudback team, they will proceed to step four (4).\n  Once contacted the Support Team will log:\n   The name of the person discovering the incident. Time the person discovering the incident contacted Cloudback. Contact information about the person discovering the incident. The nature of the incident. When the event was first noticed, supporting the idea that the incident occurred.  The Support Team member who receives the email (or discovered the incident) will refer to their contact list for both management personnel to be contacted and incident response members to be contacted. The staff member will contact those designated on the list. The staff member could possibly add the following:   Is the system affected business critical? What is the severity of the potential impact? Name of system being targeted, along with operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, and location. IP address and any information about the origin of the attack.  Contacted members of the support team will meet or discuss the situation over the telephone and determine a response strategy. The following question to be discussed:   Is the incident real or perceived? Is the incident still in progress? What data or property is threatened and how critical is it? What is the impact on the business should the attack succeed? Minimal, serious, or critical? What system or systems are targeted, where are they located physically and on the network? Is the incident inside the trusted network? Is the response urgent? Can the incident be quickly contained? Will the response alert the attacker and do we care? What type of incident is this? Example: virus, worm, intrusion, abuse, damage.  An incident ticket will be created. The incident will be categorized into the highest applicable level of one of the following categories:   Category one - A threat to public safety or life. Category two - A threat to sensitive data. Category three - A threat to computer systems. Category four - A disruption of services.  Team members will establish and follow one of the following procedures basing their response on the incident assessment:   Worm response procedure. Virus response procedure. System failure procedure. Active intrusion response procedure - Is critical or sensitive data (Personally Identifiable Information (PII), etc.) at risk? Inactive Intrusion response procedure. System abuse procedure. Property theft response procedure. Website denial of service response procedure. Database or file denial of service response procedure. Spyware response procedure.  The team may create additional procedures which are not foreseen in this document. If there is no applicable procedure in place, the team must document what was done and later establish a procedure for the incident.\n Team members will use forensic techniques, including reviewing system logs, looking for gaps in logs, reviewing intrusion detection logs, and interviewing witnesses and the incident victim to determine how the incident was caused. Only authorized personnel should be performing interviews or examining evidence, and the authorized personnel may vary by situation and the organization.\n  Team members will recommend changes to prevent the occurrence from happening again or infecting other systems.\n  Upon management approval, the changes will be implemented.\n  Team members will restore the affected system(s) to the uninfected state. They may do any or more of the following:\n   Reinstall the affected system(s) from scratch and restore data from backups if necessary. Preserve evidence before doing this. Make users change passwords if passwords may have been sniffed. Be sure the system has been hardened by turning off or uninstalling unused services. Be sure the system is fully patched. Be sure real time virus protection and intrusion detection is running. Be sure the system is logging the correct events and to the proper level.  Documentation. The following shall be documented:   How the incident was discovered. The category of the incident. How the incident occurred, whether through email, firewall, etc. Where the attack came from, such as IP addresses and other related information about the attacker. What the response plan was. What was done in response? Whether the response was effective.   Evidence Preservation. Make copies of logs, email, and other communication. Keep lists of witnesses. Keep evidence as long as necessary to complete prosecution and beyond, in case of an appeal.\n  Notify proper external agencies. Notify the police and other appropriate agencies if prosecution of the intruder is possible. List the agencies and contact numbers here.\n  Assess damage and cost—assess the damage to the organization and estimate both the damage cost and the cost of the containment efforts.\n  Review response and update policies. Plan and take preventative steps so the intrusion can\u0026rsquo;t happen again.\n   Consider whether an additional policy could have prevented the intrusion. Consider whether a procedure or policy was not followed which allowed the intrusion, and then consider what could be changed to ensure that the procedure or policy is followed in the future. Was the incident response appropriate? How could it be improved? Was every appropriate party informed in a timely manner? Were the incident response procedures detailed, and did they cover the entire situation? How can they be improved? Have changes been made to prevent a reinfection? Have all systems been patched, systems locked down, passwords changed, antivirus updated, email policies set, etc.? Have changes been made to prevent a new and similar infection? Should any security policies be updated? What lessons have been learned from this experience?

(\u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Cloudback\u0026rdquo;). It is important to understand that having a contingency plan in the event of a disaster gives Cloudback a competitive advantage. This policy requires management to financially support and diligently attend to disaster contingency planning efforts. Disasters are not limited to adverse weather conditions. Any event that could likely cause an extended delay of service is considered.\nPurpose This policy defines the requirement for a baseline disaster recovery plan to be developed and implemented by Cloudback that will describe the process to recover IT Systems, Applications and Data from any type of disaster that causes a major outage.\nScope This policy is directed to the Cloudback\u0026rsquo;s Support Team who is accountable to ensure the plan is developed, tested and kept up-to-date. This policy is solely to state the requirement to have a disaster recovery plan, it does not provide requirement around what goes into the plan or subplans.\nPolicy Contingency Plans The following contingency plans will be created if required:\n Computer Emergency Response Plan: Who is to be contacted, when, and how? What immediate actions must be taken in the event of certain occurrences? Succession Plan: Describe the flow of responsibility when normal staff is unavailable to perform their duties. Data Study: Detail the data stored on the systems, its criticality, and its confidentiality. Criticality of Service List: List all the services provided and their order of importance. It also explains the order of recovery in both short-term and long-term timeframes. Data Backup and Restoration Plan: Detail which data is backed up, the media to which it is saved, where that media is stored, and how often the backup is done. It should also describe how that data could be recovered. Equipment Replacement Plan: Describe what equipment is required to begin to provide services, list the order in which it is necessary, and note where to purchase the equipment. Mass Media Management: Who is in charge of giving information to the mass media? Also provide some guidelines on what data is appropriate to be provided.  After creating the plans, it is important to practice them to the extent possible. The time will be set to test implementation of the disaster recovery plan. Table top exercises should be conducted annually. During these tests, issues that may cause the plan to fail can be discovered and corrected in an environment that has few consequences.  The plan, at a minimum, should be reviewed an updated on an annual basis.\nPolicy Compliance Compliance Measurement The Cloudback\u0026rsquo;s Support Team will verify compliance to this policy through various methods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-thrus, video monitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and feedback to the policy owner.\nExceptions Any exception to the policy must be approved by the Cloudback\u0026rsquo;s Support Team in advance.\nNon-Compliance An employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n"});index.add({'id':15,'href':'/terms/','title':"Terms of Service",'content':"Terms of Service Introduction The Cloudback Terms of Service are between MYRTLECONSULTING S.A.

(“we” or “Cloudback”).\nOverview Vulnerability Management is the recurring process of identifying, classifying, prioritizing, mitigating, and remediating vulnerabilities. This document will focus on infrastructure vulnerabilities and the vulnerability management process. This process is designed to provide informationregarding Cloudback vulnerability workflow, promote healthy patch management among other preventative best-practices, and remediate risk; all with the end goal to better secure our environments.\nThe Vulnerability Management process Arguably the most important step for a successful vulnerability management process is defining the scope that the process will cover. Security and Infrastructure partnered to come up with a scope that would make sure all of our critical environments and systems were covered during deployment.\nCurrently, the vulnerability management consists of the following steps:\n1. Vulnerability Scanning This step is where we scan resources in our environments to identify vulnerabilities. Once setup, scans run on regular cadences that meet or exceed our requirements.\n2. Reporting/Analysis Vulnerability scan results are analyzed to provide consolidated vulnerability data and save the results in the internal bug tracking sustem as a separate issues with corresponding severity and priority. These issues are where all discussion and documentation for the vulnerability will occur. Vulnerability remediation issues should be tagged with the vulnerability type label. The following labels exist to track the vulnerability remediation workflow:\nvulnerable: This label identifies that the vulnerability has been opened, but not validated and is considered impactful to our environments per the assigned priority label. With this label a vulnerability issue should not be closed.\nvalidated: This label identifies that the vulnerability has been validated as legitimate and is scheduled for mitigation or remediation. With this label a vulnerability issue should not be closed.\nfalsepositive: This label identifies that the vulnerability has been validated as a false positive and is no longer impactful to our environments. With this label a vulnerability issue can be closed.\nexception: This label identifies that the vulnerability has been validated as legitimate and has an approved exception issue to account for a business need. In extreme circumstances, a vulnerability issue can be closed with an exception.\nmitigated: This label identifies that the vulnerability has been validated and triaged. The impact has been reduced through compensating controls, but not remediated (it is still actively identified on vulnerability scans). With this label a vulnerability issue should not be closed.\nremediated: This label identifies that the vulnerability has been remediated and the remediation has been validated. With this label a vulnerability issue can be closed.\n3. Validation Validation is an important part of vulnerability management. This is where we investigate to ensure that the vulnerability being reported has properly been identified.\nVulnerabilities can sometimes be identified during a scan, but are not actually on the system. These are classified as false positives and would go through the process to be closed as a false positive.\n4. Remediation Remediation is the part of the process in which a validated vulnerability is fixed. The remediation process would be tracked in the corresponding vulnerability issue in the internal issue tracker. SLAs are in place to help prioritize vulnerability based on severity. Once a vulnerability is remediated, we will run followup scans on the impacted systems to validate that the vulnerability is indeed remediated.\n5. Feedback The last step is for the Cloudback team to determine what we can learn from each vulnerability remediated. This may be an improvement on the vulnerability management process itself or establishing preventive mechanisms for a repetitive vulnerability type. This feedback will be documented in the vulnerability issue and could result in additional issues being opened.\nAs stated above, this process is a cyclical loop. Vulnerability scans are recurring, providing new vulnerability data that feed new vulnerability remediation and exception issues which then help update/escalate open issues/processes.\nRemediation SLAs Cloudback team has come up with remediated SLAs based on a multitude of factors, such as severity, scope, impact, etc. All of these factors will be considered when mapping the priority to Cloudback’s priority labels. The SLAs are as follows:\n   Priority Severity Mapping Time to mitigate Time to remediate     severity 1, priority 1 Zero-day Within 24 hours Within 72 hours (when technically feasible)   severity 2, priority 2 Critical N/A Within 30 days   severity 3, priority 3 High N/A Within 60 days   severity 4, priority 4 Medium N/A Within 90 days   severity 4, priority 4 Low N/A Best effort    "});})();
