      <title>What is a bare git repository and how Cloudback uses it?</title>
      <link>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/git-bare-repo/</link>

      <guid>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/git-bare-repo/</guid>
      <description>A Git bare repository represents a specialized form of a Git repository, distinct in structure and function from a conventional Git repository. Platforms like GitHub utilize bare repositories on their servers. Essentially, when a user initiates a clone command from GitHub, they are interacting with a bare repository stored on GitHub&amp;rsquo;s server. This type of repository is optimized for server-side storage and facilitates efficient and secure management and distribution of code, without the direct editing capabilities found in standard repositories.</description>

      <description>The Cloudback team is happy to announce that an alternative view for Cloudback Dashboard is released. It is a Table View.

We put the Table View Toggle in the header, so it is always easy to switch to the Table View and back to the Card View. It was a feature request of our client and we are glad to deliver it.</description>

      <title>Instant notifications of successful and failed backups</title>
      <link>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/instant-notifications/</link>

      <description>Four months ago, in February 2022, we received a new feature request from our user in our issue tracker. In the request, the user asked us to implement real-time notification support via messengers. As soon as a backup fails or succeeds, he should receive a notification. We found the request extremely useful and prioritized it in the backlog of our project. Despite the delay in delivery, we are happy to say that the work is done and the feature is now available.</description>

      <title>New feature: You can enable data deduplication to reduce storage costs</title>
      <link>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/data-deduplication/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/data-deduplication/</guid>
      <description>The Cloudback team is pleased to announce a new feature: Data deduplication for customer managed storage. The use case is a daily backup for a GitHub repository that&amp;rsquo;s not changed every day. The feature prevents wasting storage space just because Cloudback saves backup archives with the same content every day, even though nothing has changed in your GitHub repository. In certain scenarios, the feature can drastically reduce storage costs.
 The configuration of all existing customer managed storages remains unchanged and data deduplication is disabled.</description>

      <title>Archive encryption is now optional</title>
      <link>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/optional-password-protection/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/optional-password-protection/</guid>
      <description>For security reasons, Cloudback uses AES-256 encryption for all backup archives. If you download a specific backup, you can access its content using the password. The password is sent automatically to your GitHub account primary email. However, some people may find this approach a little bit overcomplicated, especially when using customer managed storage somewhere inside your own secure infrastructure.
We are glad to announce that it is possible to opt-out of password-based encryption now.</description>

      <title>We added custom email address for notifications</title>

      <guid>https://docs.cloudback.it/posts/notifications-email/</guid>
      <description>Cloudback sends an email notification to the user if the backup fails. By default, we are using the primary email address taken from the GitHub profile.
We received a feature request to support custom emails for notifications. This may be useful when you have a separate email for such kinds of notifications. We decided to provide such functionality for every account where the Cloudback GitHub Application is installed. Now you can set up a new email address for failed backup notifications for each account using the Account Settings dialog:</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, we got a new feature request in our issue tracker. One of Cloudback users asked us to add support for the OpenStack Swift storage provider. We discussed the feature request within the team and started development. We decided to use an S3 API gateway of OpenStack Swift. As a side effect, we introduced an S3 access-key-based provider in addition to OpenStack Swift. Now Cloudback supports any S3 API compatible storage provider.</description>

      <description>Our team is proud to announce to you the first public release of Cloudback - GitHub repository backup as a service. The decision to start the Cloudback project has been made a few months ago when we noticed there are no solutions that provide the ability to back up a GitHub repository into private cloud storage. We made this a key feature of our product - the integration with various cloud storage providers.</description>
